## Objective
This project aimed to improve the management of access controls for sensitive content within the company. An existing system relied on an allowlist approach, where only specified IP addresses were granted access. The objective was to develop an automated algorithm to identify and remove unauthorized IP addresses from the access list, thereby enhancing security and streamlining the access control process.

### Skills Learned

- Accessing elements in a list, iterating over a list, modifying elements in a list
- Using if statements to check conditions and execute code blocks accordingly
- Defining functions to perform specific tasks and improve code reusability
- Employed Python's file I/O functionalities to read from and write to the access control list file.


### Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps
- Access template and supporting materials
- Open the file that contains the allow list
- Read the file contents
- Convert the string into a list
- Iterate through the remove list
- Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list
- Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses
- Finalize the document
